WORKFLOW 6: ESCALATION & MAJOR INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
Focus: How incidents escalate, major incident processes, command structure, and communication
protocols. This workflow separates controlled chaos from panic.

PURPOSE & SCOPE
Most incidents are routine: assigned, diagnosed, resolved, closed. But some incidents are not
routine. A critical service goes down. Multiple dependent services are affected. Responders are
unsure if it's a platform issue or an application issue. The system needs to shift from
individual incident response to coordinated incident management. Your task is to understand the
client's escalation criteria, major incident process, incident command structure, communication
protocols, and readiness for large-scale coordination.

KEY ITOM DEPENDENCIES
• Escalation Policies: Are escalation triggers defined by severity, duration, impact, or a
  combination? Are escalation paths documented?
• Incident Commander Role: Is there a designated incident commander for major incidents? Is
  that role trained? Or does the organization default to whoever has the loudest voice?
• Communication Protocols: Is there a bridge call/Slack channel/war room for major incidents?
  Who gets notified? In what order?
• Service Dependency Mapping: Understanding which downstream services are affected by a given
  issue is critical for scope assessment and customer communication.
• Status Page Integration: Can status updates be pushed to a customer-facing status page?
• Executive Escalation: Are executives notified appropriately? Is there an executive escalation
  policy separate from technical escalation?

COMMON GAPS TO PROBE
• "We don't have a major incident process; if something is bad, we just swarm on it." (RED FLAG:
  no command structure, communication is likely to be chaotic, decisions may be reactive)
• "Escalation is manual; someone has to call the VP or the senior team." (AMBER FLAG: delays and
  single points of failure; escalation should be rules-driven)
• "We have a major incident process, but it's not followed consistently." (AMBER FLAG: ask why —
  is the process unclear? Not documented? Perceived as bureaucracy? Address the root cause.)
• "There's no incident commander; whoever can fix the problem fastest is in charge." (RED FLAG:
  technical expert ≠ incident commander; recommendation: separate technical lead from commander)
• "Executives find out about major incidents through customer calls or tweets, not from us."
  (RED FLAG: communication failure; recommend executive escalation trigger)
• "We don't have a status page; customer communication happens ad hoc." (AMBER FLAG: recommend
  status page integration as quick win for customer confidence)
• "Major incident calls happen, but notes are scattered across Slack/email/tickets; there's no
  single source of truth." (AMBER FLAG: post-incident analysis suffers; recommend incident
  command tools like Slack channel integration or dedicated war room tool)

FIELD-BY-FIELD GUIDANCE

When documenting escalation triggers:
Ask: "When does an incident become a 'Major Incident'? What are the criteria?" If the answer
is vague ("when it feels big" or "when the VP calls"), flag as RED. If criteria exist (e.g.,
"any Sev 1 lasting >30 min" or "any incident affecting >20% of users"), ask: "How consistent
is that decision? Who makes the call?" If multiple people can declare a major incident and they
don't always agree, flag as AMBER.

When documenting incident command structure:
Ask: "During a major incident, who is in charge? What is their role? What decisions do they
make?" If the answer is "the technical expert who's fixing the problem," flag as RED and explain
the difference between incident commander (manages process, communication, scope) and technical
lead (investigates/fixes). If there's no designated incident commander, flag as RED. If there is,
ask: "Is that person trained? How frequently do they exercise this role?" <annual training or
<1 major incident in past year = AMBER.

When documenting escalation notification:
Ask: "How does management get notified of a major incident? How long does it take?" If the
answer is "someone has to call them" or "they check email," flag as RED. Request the escalation
chain (team lead -> manager -> director -> VP). If the chain is >5 levels deep, ask: "How long
does it take to get from incident to VP awareness?" >30 minutes for Sev 1 = RED.

When documenting incident communication protocol:
Ask: "When there's a major incident, where do responders and stakeholders coordinate? Slack?
Bridge call? War room?" If multiple channels are used simultaneously, flag as AMBER: message
fragmentation risk. If a dedicated channel/call is used, ask: "Who facilitates? Who takes notes?
Where are notes stored after the incident?" If notes are scattered or lost, flag as AMBER and
recommend war room tool integration.

When documenting customer communication:
Ask: "Who communicates incident status to customers? How often? What channel?" If communication
is manual, flag as AMBER and ask: "How consistent is the messaging?" If external status page
exists, ask: "Who updates it? How quickly? Is it automated from ServiceNow?" Automated = GREEN,
manual = AMBER.

When documenting service dependency visibility during incidents:
Ask: "During a critical incident, can you quickly see which customer-facing services are
affected? Where does that information come from?" If the answer is "we have to figure it out
from the alert" or "someone looks at the topology document," flag as AMBER. If the dependency
map is in ServiceNow and responders can query it, mark as GREEN.

When documenting post-incident procedures:
Ask: "After a major incident, do you hold a retrospective? How long after the incident? Who
attends? Is the outcome documented?" If retrospectives are not held or are rare, flag as RED.
If they are held but findings are not tracked, flag as AMBER and recommend using ServiceNow
for action item tracking.

When documenting incident metrics and SLAs:
Ask: "Do you track metrics for major incidents (detection time, escalation time, resolution
time, impact)? Are there SLAs?" If not, flag as AMBER and recommend establishing baseline
metrics. If metrics exist, ask to see the last 3-6 months of data.

PROBING QUESTIONS TO TRIGGER DEPTH

• "Walk me through the last major incident. Who declared it? How long before it was escalated
  to management? How was communication handled? Was there a retrospective?"
• "Have you had a major incident where responders didn't know what was going on and the customer
  found out before you did? What happened?"
• "If a major incident happened right now, could you stand up a war room and have key people on
  a call within 5 minutes? Who would you need to call? In what order?"
• "How is on-call structured for escalation? Is there a separate on-call person for incident
  commander role, or is it combined with technical on-call?"
• "Have you had a situation where decisions made during an incident conflicted? How was that
  resolved?"

EXPECTED OUTPUTS FOR DOWNSTREAM WORKFLOWS

This workflow must document:
• Escalation triggers and major incident criteria
• Incident commander role definition and training status
• Escalation notification chains and timing
• Incident communication protocol and coordination tools
• Customer communication process and status page integration
• Service dependency visibility and data sources
• Retrospective/PIR cadence and follow-up tracking
• Incident metrics baseline and SLAs
• Historical major incidents (list, duration, impact, root cause)

Critical escalation gaps cause:
• Delayed executive awareness and customer communication
• Chaotic coordination with conflicting decisions or duplicated effort
• Lost incident context due to scattered notes
• Repeated failures from retrospective findings not being implemented
• Customer loss of confidence due to lack of communication or inconsistent messaging

Major incident process maturity is a direct reflection of operational maturity. Invest here
in formalizing command structure, communication protocols, and retrospective discipline. Quick
wins: incident commander training, status page integration, war room tool adoption.
