WORKFLOW 4: ASSIGNMENT & COORDINATION
Focus: How incidents are routed to the right team/individual, how handoffs work, and how
escalation authority is delegated. This workflow determines whether skilled people get the
right problem at the right time or whether incidents bounce around like pinballs.

PURPOSE & SCOPE
Once an incident is triaged and correlated, it must reach the person or team best positioned
to resolve it. Assignment decisions are constrained by skill, availability, on-call schedules,
team geography, and escalation authority. Your task is to understand how assignment routing
currently works — both the formal rules (if they exist) and the informal workarounds that
make it happen in reality.

KEY ITOM DEPENDENCIES
• CMDB CI Ownership: Does each significant CI (server, application, database, network segment)
  have a documented owner or owning team in the CMDB? Is that data current and trusted?
  If not, assignment routing cannot be automated.
• Assignment Group Configuration: Does ServiceNow have assignment groups that correspond to
  the client's operational structure? Are assignment groups tied to specific skills or
  technologies?
• On-Call Schedule Integration: Are on-call schedules integrated with ServiceNow? Can assignment
  rules automatically route to the person currently on-call for a given team?
• Escalation Policies: Are escalation paths documented (Team A escalates to Team B escalates to
  Team C)? Are escalation criteria tied to time, severity, or specific conditions?
• Team Skills & Specialization: Which teams handle which technologies? Is there skill redundancy
  or single points of knowledge failure?

COMMON GAPS TO PROBE
• "We assign incidents manually based on who we know." (RED FLAG: tribal knowledge, single
  points of failure, inconsistent SLA adherence)
• "Assignment groups exist in ServiceNow but don't match our actual team structure." (AMBER FLAG:
  routing rules will misfire; ask when assignment group config was last synced with org changes)
• "We have an on-call schedule, but it's in PagerDuty / Splunk-On-Call / a spreadsheet, not
  integrated with ServiceNow." (RED FLAG: assignment cannot auto-route; on-call person has to
  manually pick up or be notified separately)
• "The CMDB lists team owners, but we don't trust that data." (DEPENDENCY GAP: RED: cannot
  automate assignment until ownership data is validated)
• "We escalate based on severity, but there's no documented escalation path." (AMBER FLAG:
  escalation is ad-hoc; ask for recent example of escalation to understand real logic)
• "Our escalation escalates to senior staff, but they're often in meetings or unreachable."
  (RED FLAG: escalation path is broken; on-call coverage gap)
• "We have one person who knows everything about our middleware; all incidents get assigned to
  them." (RED FLAG: single point of failure, SLA at risk, burnout risk; knowledge must be
  documented or distributed)

FIELD-BY-FIELD GUIDANCE

When documenting assignment group structure:
Ask: "How is your operations team organized? What are the primary support tiers or technology
domains?" Then ask: "How does that organization map to ServiceNow assignment groups?"
If there's misalignment, flag as AMBER and note the gap. If assignment groups are not used
and all incidents are assigned to individuals, flag as RED: routing will not scale, and turnover
will break processes.

When documenting CI ownership data:
Ask: "Does the CMDB have an owner field populated for critical CIs? When was it last validated?"
Request a sample of 10 critical CIs and their owners. Spot-check: ask an ops manager "is this
person/team still responsible for this system?" If more than 20% are inaccurate, flag as
[DEPENDENCY GAP] RED. If less than 50% of critical CIs have an owner listed, flag as RED.

When documenting on-call integration:
Ask: "How does the on-call person know they have an incident? Do they get notified from
ServiceNow, or do they have to check a separate tool?" If they have to check a separate tool,
flag as RED: notification is delayed and error-prone. Ask: "If someone is on-call and gets
reassigned in PagerDuty, does ServiceNow know about it?" If not, flag as AMBER and recommend
integration as a quick win.

When documenting assignment routing logic:
Ask: "Walk me through how an incident gets assigned. Is there a rule? A team that does triage
assignment? Or does it bounce around?" If the answer involves multiple manual handoffs, flag
as RED. If there is a rule, ask to see it (do not assume it's documented). If it's not
documented, flag as RED. If it's documented, ask: "How often does this rule successfully route
an incident to the right team on the first try? What percentage of incidents need manual
reassignment?"

When documenting escalation paths:
Ask: "If a Sev 1 incident isn't resolved within 30 minutes, what happens? Who do you escalate
to? How do they get notified?" Request the documented escalation path (if it exists). If it
doesn't exist, ask for the last example of escalation. Note the reality vs. policy. If escalation
time (from incident creation to senior person engaged) is >60 minutes for Sev 1, flag as RED.

When documenting skill gaps or single points of failure:
Ask: "Are there any systems or technologies where only one person knows how to handle issues?
Are there any teams that are consistently overloaded?" If yes to either, flag as RED and
document the specific role/technology. Ask: "What's your cross-training plan?" If there isn't
one, flag as AMBER and recommend knowledge documentation (runbooks, wikis, ServiceNow KB).

When documenting geographic or timezone distribution:
Ask: "Does your ops team work in multiple time zones? How do you handle escalation across
time zones?" If answer is "we wake up the Asia-Pacific team at 3 AM," flag as RED for escalation
fairness and recommend on-call rotation design review.

PROBING QUESTIONS TO TRIGGER DEPTH

• "Walk me through the last Critical incident. Who got assigned? How long until they saw it?
  Did it get reassigned? Why?"
• "What happens if the person assigned to an incident is not available? Who picks it up?"
• "Have you had a situation where an incident bounced between teams because no one wanted to
  own it? What was that?"
• "Who has the authority to declare a Major Incident and stand up a war room? How do they get
  notified?"
• "If a vendor (e.g., a SaaS provider) has responsibility for part of the infrastructure, how
  is that handled in your assignment process?"

EXPECTED OUTPUTS FOR DOWNSTREAM WORKFLOWS

This workflow must document:
• Organization chart mapped to ServiceNow assignment groups
• CMDB CI ownership coverage and accuracy assessment
• On-call schedule system and integration status
• Assignment routing rules (automated and manual)
• Escalation policy and execution effectiveness
• Known single points of knowledge failure
• Geographic/timezone distribution and escalation implications
• Average time from incident creation to assignment completion
• Frequency of mis-assignments and re-routing

Critical assignment gaps cause:
• Incident delay as incidents wait for manual assignment or discovery
• Escalation delays as critical issues are assigned to junior staff who should have escalated
  immediately
• Burnout and turnover in overloaded teams
• SLA breaches due to missed or late assignment
• Lost context through multiple handoffs without proper documentation

Strong assignment routing is the backbone of predictable, timely incident response. Invest
heavily in CMDB ownership validation and on-call integration here.
